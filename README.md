# Overview

This project was our attempt to design 3D game elements as a sort of plugin for Python's pygame module that you would eventually be able to easily integrate into your own pygame application. Due to time and skill constraints, the software currently spawns the "player" in a small 3D box. You can look around with mouse movement and move using the WASD keys. There is also a feature to create very basic shapes, but development of that feature is still in its very rudementary form.

# Development Environment

We used VSCode and Python, mainly focusing around the use of the 'pygame' module and integrating many features from the 'PyOpenGL' module as well.

# Future Work

* Currently, the create object feature is very bugged and needs a lot of work.
* Gravity doesn't yet exist in the sandbox, which makes movement a bit awkward depending on how the camera is oriented
* More dynamic control over shapes
* A user interface to allow the user to "create" an environment, that can then be tested and run in a sandbox
* Menus and other aesthetics
